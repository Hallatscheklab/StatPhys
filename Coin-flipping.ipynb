    "### Coarse-graining\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of statistical physics, the concept of **coarse-graining** plays a pivotal role in understanding the transition from microscopic to macroscopic descriptions. The entire configuration of a system, denoted by $\\{\\sigma\\} = \\left\\{\\sigma_{1}, \\sigma_{2}, \\ldots\\right\\}$, represents the **micro-state**. The set of all micro-states encompasses all possible configurations at the most fundamental level.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**However, we are rarely concerned with the exact details of individual microstates. Instead, we focus on features common to all typical microstates.** In most cases, the specific microstate of a system—such as the precise arrangement of spins in a solid or the exact positions and momenta of molecules in a glass of water—offers little insight into its macroscopic behavior. Questions like “What happens to water when it is heated?” or “How does a balloon respond to pressure?” relate to emergent properties derived from the shared characteristics of the vast number of possible microstates in a macroscopic system (on the order of Avogadro’s number).\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, when observing a sequence of coin flips represented as 1’s and 0’s, we are generally uninterested in the precise order of outcomes. Instead, we notice patterns, such as the balance between 1’s and 0’s. This leads us to consider quantities like the total number of heads $N_+$, tails $N_-$, or their difference,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X \\equiv \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\sigma_{j}=N_+ - N_-\\;.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in a magnet, individual spins are difficult to measure, but we can focus on macroscopic quantities like the magnetization, which is also expressed as $X = N_+ - N_-$, the net difference between up and down spins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since mapping ${\\sigma} \\rightarrow X$ reduces detailed information to a single summary quantity, $X$ is known as a macroscopic observable. Fixing $X$ defines a macrostate, which captures the system’s behavior at a higher level of abstraction. (The associated loss of information is a key quantity central to both information theory and statistical mechanics. More on that later.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**A primary goal in statistical physics is to transition from the probability distribution of microstates, $P({\\sigma})$, to the probability distribution of macrostates, $P(X)$.** Understanding this transformation is central to the discipline. To explore this, consider a coin-flipping example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of observing a macrostate $X$ depends on two factors: the number of microstates $\\binom{N}{N_+}$ consistent with $X$, and the probability $p^{N_+}q^{N_-}$ of any specific microstate. This yields the binomial distribution:\n",
    "\n",
