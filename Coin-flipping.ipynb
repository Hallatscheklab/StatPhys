    "\n",
    "We will use the simple example of repeatedly flipping a biased coin as a warm-up excercise to illustrate key concepts in statistical physics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Coin flipping arises in many context:\n",
    "- spatial configuration of magnetic moments: 1D Ising spin chain \n",
    "- time series of left- or right steps in a random walk or a polymer (1D freely jointed chain)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that the coin is flipped $N$ times (~\"volume\" of spin chain) and describe the outcome of coin flip $i$ as $\\sigma_{i} \\in\\{-1,+1\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a single coin flip, the probabilities of heads and tails are \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P\\left(\\sigma_{i}\\right)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}p \\;, \\quad\\sigma=1 \\\\ q=1-p\\;, \\quad \\sigma=-1\\end{array}\\right.\\;,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which can also be concisely expressed as $P\\left(\\sigma_{i}\\right)=p \\cdot \\delta_{\\sigma_i 1}+q \\delta_{\\sigma_i 0}$, which is sometimes useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since coin flips are uncorrelated (by assumption), the probability of observing a particular configuration is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "### Coarse-graining\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of statistical physics, the concept of **coarse-graining** plays a pivotal role in understanding the transition from microscopic to macroscopic descriptions. The entire configuration of a system, denoted by $\\{\\sigma\\} = \\left\\{\\sigma_{1}, \\sigma_{2}, \\ldots\\right\\}$, represents the **micro-state**. The set of all micro-states encompasses all possible configurations at the most fundamental level.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But, usually, we cannot directly observe all degrees of freedom of a microstate. Instead, we measure certain observables that have the same value for many microstates. For example, we typically cannot measure all spins in a magnet but just a sum over all spins. In a magnet, for instance, we care about the magnetization, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$X \\equiv \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\sigma_{j}\\;,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is the difference $X=N_+-N_-$ between up- and down-spins. (Likewise, when we stare at a coin flip series of 1's and 0's our brains tend to quickly notice if there's a mismatch between 1's and 0's.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Since $\\{\\sigma\\} \\rightarrow X$ is a many-to-one mapping, we call $X$ a macroscopic observable. By fixing the value of $X$, we effectively define what is known as a **macro-state**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical objective in statistical physics is to transition from the probability distribution of micro-states, $P(\\{\\sigma\\})$, to that of macro-states, $P(X)$. What generically happens during this transition is a fundamental aspect that we will explore now,  using coin flipping.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of $X$ is naturally represented as a product of the number $\\binom{N}{N_+}$ of possible microstates (aka microscopic configurations) and the probability $p^{N_{+}}q^{N_{-}}$ to observe anyone of the microstates. We thus obtain the binomial distribution\n",
