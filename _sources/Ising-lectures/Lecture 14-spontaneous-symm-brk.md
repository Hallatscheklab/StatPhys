Consider an $\mathrm{Fe}$ bar magnet, which produces a macroscopic B-field.

The $\mathrm{Fe}$ is in eq. at finite -T, so should be described by $\rho \sim e^{-\beta+1}$.

But this is puzzling! The laws of physics are invariant under time reversal. symmetry, which takes $B \rightarrow-B$ (really... CPT) So

$$
\begin{aligned}
E\left(\Delta_{S}^{N}\right) & =E\left(\Delta_{N}^{S}\right)^{S} \\
p\left(\Delta_{S}^{N}\right) & =\rho\left(\Delta_{N}^{S}\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$

Why do we

see $B$ in eq.? I should first note it depends on $T$ : there is a phase transition at

First, a simplified microscopic picture. Each electron carries a bar magnet, it's spin:

tidy. If all spins align, this produces a net B-field; if they arrange randomly in space on time, $B \rightarrow 0$.

In turns out that in some (but not all) materials, the interplay of coulomb repulsion and fermionic statistics gives rise to a ferromagnet "exchange" interaction - Tex $\vec{S}_{i} \cdot \vec{S}_{j} \in \widehat{H}$ between nearby electrons. You can think of $H=-J \sum_{\langle i, j\rangle} \sigma_{i} \sigma_{j}$ as a phenomenological treatment of this; $\sigma= \pm 1$ denotes whether some little spatial cube has net

magnetization.

[You might ask why not $\vec{S}=\left(S_{x}, S_{y}, S_{z}\right)$, $|\vec{s}|^{2}=1, \quad H=-J \sum_{\langle i, j\rangle} \vec{s}_{i} \cdot \vec{s}_{j}$ ? That's called the "Heisenberg" model. That is indeed a better model for some materials, but more complicated. In other materials,
spin-orbit coupling picks a special axis "z" along which spins prefer to align, so we only need $\sigma=s^{z}$.

In the all-to-all model, the free energy at fixed magnetization $m$ develops double minima for $T<T_{c}$ :

SS $B$ is just the system picking $\pm \bar{m}$ to lower $F=N \cdot f$

Now you might ask: what really happens when you sit right at $B=0$. Is $m \neq 0$ ? IT depends both on $N$, and how patient you are!

(1) Dynamical explanation. Suppose

$T<T_{c}$, with $N$ large but finite. At time $t=0$, start in $(\uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \cdots)$ and evolve under $\hat{H}$ : $\quad$ per spin

If you average over all time, you will find $\langle m\rangle=0$. But for $N \sim 10^{23}$, $\Delta t \sim e^{10^{23}} \Delta f>$ age of universe.

So in practice, you sample only the "ä¸ª" basin. There is a breakdown of ergodicity as $N \rightarrow \infty$ : results depend on initial state.

(2) $B \rightarrow 0_{+}, N \rightarrow \infty$ explanation

In the all-to-all homework you find that for $T<T_{c}$

$$
\langle m\rangle_{B}=\bar{m} \tanh (\beta N \bar{m} B)
$$

$\langle m\rangle_{B}=\bar{m} \tanh (\beta N \bar{m} B)$

$N$ finite,

As $\lim _{B \rightarrow 0} m=0$

As $\quad N \rightarrow \infty \quad\langle m\rangle_{B}=\bar{m} \operatorname{sign}(B)$

(m) becomes discontinuous below $T_{c}$

& \uparrow \downarrow \rrbracket^{\text {critical point" }} \\

& T_{c} \\
& T \\
& f=-\frac{1}{\beta} \ln (z) \\
& \partial g f=-\frac{1}{\beta} \frac{\partial g Z}{Z}
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $m=-\partial_{B} f$, we can infer

free -energy:

Finite- $N$ effect:

Again, this is where "first order" nomenclature come from: first-derivative $\partial_{B} F$ is discontinuous so observables "jump" (discontinuous) across transition.

First order m

"Second order"

First order (but not and) exhibit the dynamical phenomena of hysteresis.

If you sweep $B(t)$ in time quickly across phase boundary

Fast slower

Really Slow
Occurs because finite but not $O\left(e^{N}\right)+i m e$ for bubble nucleation

First-order phase boundaries can terminate $a+2$ and order critical points

Symmetry breaking is umbiquoutus:

crystallization (translation); nematicity (rotation); superconductivity (charge conservation) $U(1)$ Anderson-Higgs mechanism

$$
\begin{aligned}
& S_{\text {riggs }}=\left|D_{\mu} \phi\right|^{2}-\overbrace{\frac{\lambda}{4}\left(|\phi|^{2}-V^{2}\right)^{2}}^{V(\phi)} \\
& T=0 \Rightarrow F[\phi]=H[\phi]
\end{aligned}
$$

(interesting effects from gauge symmetry, as in
super conductivity)
