What matters is not only the Boltzmann factor but also how many states the *system* has with a given energy.  "

    "Usually there is a pronounced tradeoff between the two factors appearing in this equation. As the system energy increases, we gain a lot of new system states. But with increasing system energy, we also loose increasingly loose bath states, in fact at an exponential rate precisely given by the Boltzmann factor. The result is a pronounced peak of the product of both factors at a particular energy $U$. This typical situation is depicted below."
