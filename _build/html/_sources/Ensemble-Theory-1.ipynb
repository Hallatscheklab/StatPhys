Macroscopic systems, such as ferromagnetic systems below the Curie temperature, can demonstrate ergodicity breaking, where they do not explore all possible states as predicted by the ergodic hypothesis. This results in phenomena like spontaneous magnetization, a form of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Similarly, complex disordered systems like spin glasses and conventional glasses, like window glasses, exhibit more intricate forms of ergodicity breaking. These systems can appear solid over short timescales, like seconds or hours, due to their positive shear modulus, but over very long periods, like millennia, they behave more like liquids, displaying multiple time scales and intermediate plateaus in behavior."

    "As another frequent application of Boltzmann’s law are state populations of two state systems, as we find them frequently in physics, e.g., for spin systems. Such two level spin systems are, for example, very important for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which is an important tool to study the structure and dynamics of soft matter.\n",

This then means that the excess number of protons in the excited state is just $N_{+\\frac{1}{2}}-N_{-\\frac{1}{2}}=4.5\\times 10^{12}$, which is extremely low. Thus, to detect something in NMR or MRI, a certain number of protons in the volume is required.    \n",
